# Mars News and Weather Analysis
This project is focused on web-scraping and data analysis of information related to Mars. The project consists of two parts: Part 1 is a Jupyter notebook containing code that scrapes the Mars news titles and preview text. Part 2 is a Jupyter notebook containing code that scrapes the Mars weather data and that cleans, visualizes, and analyzes that data.

# Technical Skills

### On average, the third month has the coldest minimum temperature on Mars, and the eighth month is the "warmest". But it is always very cold there in human terms!

## #4. Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars?

### Month 6 has the lowest atmospheric pressure, while month 9 has the highest

## #5. About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year?

### There are 687 Earth days in a Martian year. As visualized by the chart, the distance from peak to peak is roughly 1425-750, or 675 days. A year on Mars appears to be about 675 days from the plot. Internet search confirms that a Mars year is equivalent to 687 earth days.

# Project Parameters
- Deliverable 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News (40 points)
    - Automated browsing (with Splinter) was used to visit the Mars news site, and the HTML code was extracted (with Beautiful Soup)
    - The titles and preview text of the news articles were scraped and extracted
    - The scraped information was stored in the specified Python data structureâ€”specifically, a list of dictionaries

- Deliverable 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data
    - The HTML table was extracted into a Pandas DataFrame. Splinter and Beautiful Soup were used to scrape the data. The columns have the correct headings and data types
    - The data was analyzed to answer all five listed questions, with data visualizations provided when specified
    - The DataFrame was exported into a CSV file
